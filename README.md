Summary:

The purpose of this engineering diploma thesis is to implement Wave Terrain sound synthesis in the form of a computer simulation. The synthesis parameters are generated by the user, who controls the movement of a listener (a sound receiver) on a confined surface in a similar manner to controlling a character in a first-person computer game. The space in which the listener is placed is filled with audio samples loaded from a given file. They constitute a data structure which is analogous to the wave terrain, although it has three dimensions instead of two. This thesis presents basic information about Wave Terrain sound synthesis and the Unity game development environment.  The development of the project consisted of creating a demonstration board, along with a user interface that enables changing the simulation parameters in the Unity environment and implementing C# algorithms which allow for sound synthesis and gameplay control.
